# READMEkeplaw
This README contains my completion of Kepler's Law. This file includes the code and completion of the pre-code questions. 

## Introductory Questions 
1) To code a^3: 
   double MAu = Mconversion * MercuryA; // The planets' AU
   double a5 = Math.pow(MAu, 3);
   
   
2) To code pi^2:
   *double a2 = Math.PI; 
   *double a3 = Math.pow(a2, 2);

3) The demoninator
     double b2 = MercuryM + MM; // This is the first half of the denominator 
     double b = MG * b2; // This is the denominator of the equation

4) The numerator
       double a2 = Math.PI; 
       double a3 = Math.pow(a2, 2);
       double a4 = 4 * a3;
       double a5 = Math.pow(MAu, 3);
       double a = a5 * a4; // The final numerator of the equation
5a) The variables used for all planets:
  final double MM = 1.989e30;   // this is defined as a constant (M) in which all equations follow
  final double MG = 6.6743015e-11; // this is the universal gravitational constant

5b) The variables that changed: 
  a) The mass of each planet 
  b) The distance away from the sun 

## Final Questions 

1) It took me about 2 hours to complete this assignment
2) I thought this assignment was really interesting and it was very relevant to the real world.
